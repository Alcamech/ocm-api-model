// ManagedIdentitiesRequirementsBuilder contains the data and logic needed to build 'managed_identities_requirements' objects.
//
// Representation of managed identities requirements.
// When creating ARO-HCP Clusters, the end-users will need to pre-create the set of Managed Identities
// required by the clusters.
// The set of Managed Identities that the end-users need to precreate is not static and depends on
// several factors:
// (1) The OpenShift version of the cluster being created.
// (2) The functionalities that are being enabled for the cluster. Some Managed Identities are not
// always required but become required if a given functionality is enabled.
// Additionally, the Managed Identities that the end-users will need to precreate will have to have a
// set of required permissions assigned to them which also have to be returned to the end users.
